# Learning Management System (LMS) - Backend Domain Logic

A simplified backend implementation for a Learning Management System that governs student access to course content based on enrolment and scheduling rules. Built using Test-Driven Development(TDD) in PHP.

## Overview

This project implements the core business logic for determining whether a student can access specific content (lessons, homework, prep materials) based on:
- Course schedule (start/end dates)
- Student enrolment status
- Content-specific availability rules
- Multiple enrolment handling

## Features

### Access Control Rules
- **Course Start Date** - Students cannot access content before the course begins
- **Course End Date** - Properly handles courses with optional end dates (ongoing courses)
- **Enrolment Validity** - Students must have an active enrolment during the access attempt
- **Lesson Scheduling** - Lessons are only available from their scheduled date/time
- **Content Types** - Different rules for Lessons, Homework, and Prep Materials
- **Multiple Enrolments** - Handles students enrolled in multiple courses and renewed enrolments

### Domain Models
- **Student** - Manages multiple enrolments
- **Course** - Contains start/end dates and content
- **Enrolment** - Links students to courses with date ranges
- **Content** (abstract) - Base class for all content types
  - **Lesson** - Available from scheduled datetime
  - **Homework** - Available from course start
  - **PrepMaterial** - Available from course start
- **AccessController** - Validates access based on all rules

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **PHP 8.1+** - Modern PHP with constructor property promotion
- **PHPUnit 10.x** - Testing framework
- **Composer** - Dependency management
- **PSR-4** - Autoloading standard

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/azamzamy/learning-mgmt-system.git

```

## üß™ Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
vendor/bin/phpunit

# Run with detailed output
vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox

# Run with colors

```

### Test Coverage

**8 comprehensive tests, 10 assertions** covering:
1. ‚úî Student cannot access content before course starts
2. ‚úî Student cannot access content after enrolment ends
3. ‚úî Student can access content in ongoing course with no end date
4. ‚úî Student cannot access lesson before scheduled time
5. ‚úî Student can access lesson after scheduled time
6. ‚úî Student with multiple enrolments can access enrolled course
7. ‚úî Student cannot access course they are not enrolled in
8. ‚úî Student with renewed enrolment can access during extended period

## Usage Example

```php
<?php

use LMS\AccessController;
use LMS\Course;
use LMS\Student;
use LMS\Enrolment;
use LMS\Lesson;
use DateTime;

// Create a course
$course = new Course(
    name: 'A-Level Biology',
    startDate: new DateTime('2025-05-13'),
    endDate: new DateTime('2025-06-12')
);

// Create a student
$student = new Student(name: 'Emma');

// Create a lesson
$lesson = new Lesson(
    title: 'Cell Structure',
    course: $course,
    scheduledDateTime: new DateTime('2025-05-15 10:00:00')
);

// Enrol the student
$enrolment = new Enrolment(
    student: $student,
    course: $course,
    startDate: new DateTime('2025-05-01'),
    endDate: new DateTime('2025-05-30')
);
$student->addEnrolment($enrolment);

// Check access
$accessController = new AccessController();
$canAccess = $accessController->canAccess(
    student: $student,
    content: $lesson,
    dateTime: new DateTime('2025-05-15 10:01:00')
);

// Result: true (student can access after lesson starts)
```

## Architecture

### Clean Code Principles
- **Single Responsibility** - Each class has one clear purpose
- **Encapsulation** - Business logic contained within domain models
- **Dependency Inversion** - Abstract Content base class for extensibility
- **Test-Driven Development** - All features developed using Red-Green-Refactor cycle

### AccessController Design
The `AccessController` uses private helper methods for clarity:
- `isCourseActiveOn()` - Validates course date range
- `hasValidEnrolment()` - Checks for active enrolment
- `isContentAvailableOn()` - Handles content-specific rules

## Development Process

This project was built following strict TDD methodology:

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
1. **RED** - Write a failing test
2. **GREEN** - Write minimal code to pass the test
3. **REFACTOR** - Improve code structure without changing behavior


**Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è using Test-Driven Development**
