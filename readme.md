# Learning Management System (LMS) - Backend Domain Logic

A simplified backend implementation for a Learning Management System that governs student access to course content based on enrolment and scheduling rules. Built using Test-Driven Development(TDD) in PHP.

## Overview

This project implements the core business logic for determining whether a student can access specific content (lessons, homework, prep materials) based on:
- Course schedule (start/end dates)
- Student enrolment status
- Content-specific availability rules
- Multiple enrolment handling

## Features

### Access Control Rules
- **Course Start Date** - Students cannot access content before the course begins
- **Course End Date** - Properly handles courses with optional end dates (ongoing courses)
- **Enrolment Validity** - Students must have an active enrolment during the access attempt
- **Lesson Scheduling** - Lessons are only available from their scheduled date/time
- **Content Types** - Different rules for Lessons, Homework, and Prep Materials
- **Multiple Enrolments** - Handles students enrolled in multiple courses and renewed enrolments

### Domain Models
- **Course** (Aggregate Root) - Manages course schedule and all content items
- **Student** (Aggregate Root) - Manages enrolments and orchestrates access control
- **ContentItem** (Value Object) - Represents lessons, homework, and prep materials with availability rules

### Test Coverage

**11 comprehensive tests, 13 assertions** covering:
1. ‚úî Student cannot access content before course starts
2. ‚úî Student can access prep material after course starts
3. ‚úî Student can access content on exact course start date
4. ‚úî Student cannot access content after enrolment ends
5. ‚úî Student can access content in ongoing course with no end date
6. ‚úî Student cannot access lesson before scheduled time
7. ‚úî Student can access lesson after scheduled time
8. ‚úî Student can access lesson at exact scheduled time
9. ‚úî Student with multiple enrolments can access enrolled course
10. ‚úî Student cannot access course they are not enrolled in
11. ‚úî Student with renewed enrolment can access during extended period


## Usage Example

```php
<?php

use LMS\AccessController;
use LMS\Course;
use LMS\Student;
use LMS\Enrolment;
use LMS\Lesson;
use DateTime;

// Create a course
$course = new Course(
    name: 'A-Level Biology',
    startDate: new DateTime('2025-05-13'),
    endDate: new DateTime('2025-06-12')
);

// Create a student
$student = new Student(name: 'Emma');

// Create a lesson
$lesson = new Lesson(
    title: 'Cell Structure',
    course: $course,
    scheduledDateTime: new DateTime('2025-05-15 10:00:00')
);

// Enrol the student
$enrolment = new Enrolment(
    student: $student,
    course: $course,
    startDate: new DateTime('2025-05-01'),
    endDate: new DateTime('2025-05-30')
);
$student->addEnrolment($enrolment);

// Check access
$accessController = new AccessController();
$canAccess = $accessController->canAccess(
    student: $student,
    content: $lesson,
    dateTime: new DateTime('2025-05-15 10:01:00')
);

// Result: true (student can access after lesson starts)
```

## Development Process

This project was built following strict TDD methodology:

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
1. **RED** - Write a failing test
2. **GREEN** - Write minimal code to pass the test
3. **REFACTOR** - Improve code structure without changing behavior

## Architecture:

Decided to refactor the implementation to use **Aggregate Root pattern** from Domain-Driven Design (DDD) as an opportunity to learn more about the approach, reducing complexity by consolidating related entities into aggregates.

#### **Course Aggregate Root**
The `Course` class serves as an aggregate root that owns and manages its content:

**Key principle:** Content cannot exist independently of a Course - it's always accessed through the Course aggregate.

#### **Student Aggregate Root**
The `Student` class manages enrolments and orchestrates access control:

**Key principle:** Business logic for access control lives in the domain objects, not external services.

---

## Consious Design Decisions:

### 1. ContentItem Objects vs Arrays

In the aggregate root refactoring, I chose to represent content as **ContentItem value objects** rather than associative arrays:

```php
// Array approach
$content = [
    'type' => 'lesson',
    'title' => 'Cell Structure',
    'scheduledDateTime' => new DateTime('2025-05-15 10:00:00')
];

// Object approach
$content = new ContentItem(
    type: 'lesson',
    title: 'Cell Structure',
    scheduledDateTime: new DateTime('2025-05-15 10:00:00')
);
```

#### Why Objects Over Arrays?

##### 1. **Type Safety**
```php
// With arrays - typos cause runtime errors
echo $content['titel'];  // null, silent failure

// With objects - typos caught at compile time
echo $content->getTitel();  // Fatal error: method doesn't exist
```

##### 2. **IDE Support**
```php
// With arrays - no autocomplete
$content['???']  // You need to remember the keys

// With objects - full autocomplete
$content->get...  // IDE suggests: getType(), getTitle(), getScheduledDateTime()
```

##### 3. **Encapsulation**
```php
// With arrays - logic scattered across the codebase
if ($content['type'] === 'lesson') {
    return $at >= $content['scheduledDateTime'];
}

// With objects - logic encapsulated in the value object
return $content->isAvailableAt($at);  // Business logic lives where it belongs
```

##### 4. **Refactoring Safety**
```php
// With arrays - changing structure breaks everything
$content['scheduled_time']  // Changed from 'scheduledDateTime'
// All code using this key must be manually found and updated ‚ùå

// With objects - change internal implementation, keep public API
class ContentItem {
    private ?DateTime $scheduledDateTime;  // Can rename this freely
    
    public function getScheduledDateTime(): ?DateTime {  // Public API stays same
        return $this->scheduledDateTime;
    }
}
```

##### 5. **Prevents Invalid State**
```php
// With arrays - can create invalid data
$content = [
    'type' => 'lesson',
    'scheduledDateTime' => null  // Invalid! Lessons need scheduled time ‚ùå
];

// With objects - constructor ensures valid state
class ContentItem {
    public function __construct(
        private string $type,
        private string $title,
        private ?DateTime $scheduledDateTime = null
    ) {
        // Could add validation here
        if ($type === 'lesson' && $scheduledDateTime === null) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException('Lessons require scheduled time');
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Separating StudentAAccessControlTests from StudentTests

To maintain clarity and separation of concerns, I created a dedicated test class `StudentAccessControlTests` specifically for access control scenarios, distinct from general `StudentTests`.
